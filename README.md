Mostly half-working html websites from INF.03 exams :3

#IMPORTANT!!
I haven't taken any of the exams as I followed a different route in education. Therefore I only solve this things for fun and there is a high probability that it wouldn't score even 50% in the actual exam. Yet, being someone who have seen them for the first time in my life I wanted a challenge. I feel proud of the work I've done and I want to have it archived here. Enjoy!
